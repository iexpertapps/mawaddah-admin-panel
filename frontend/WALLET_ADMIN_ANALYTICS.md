# Mawaddah Wallet Admin Analytics – Backend & Frontend Enhancements

---

## 1. Legacy Flow Removal & Analytics API
- The legacy wallet withdrawal approval flow was fully removed from both backend (Django) and frontend (React).
- New admin analytics endpoints were implemented:
  - `/api/wallet/admin/overview/` (platform stats)
  - `/api/wallet/admin/recipients/` (recipient stats)
  - `/api/wallet/admin/recipients/<user_id>/withdrawals/` and `/transfers/`
- Endpoints are protected with `IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser`.
- Comprehensive DRF tests were written and passed.

## 2. Frontend Integration
- The `/admin/wallet` page was built to use the new endpoints, with stat cards, a paginated/searchable table, and a drawer for transaction/withdrawal history.
- UI/UX matches the Appeals page, using shared components and Airbnb code standards.
- Stat cards and table were updated to use the new endpoints and display values in `Rs 12k` format.

## 3. Sample Data Seeding
- A management command was created to seed realistic sample data (recipients, donors, wallets, transactions).
- Issues with wallet creation and transaction fields were fixed.
- Dummy appeals were created for each recipient to satisfy model constraints.

## 4. Debugging & Backend/Frontend Sync
- Issues with missing data were traced to the frontend using old endpoints.
- The frontend was updated to use the new admin analytics endpoints.
- Backend was updated to return all fields needed by the frontend.
- Stat cards and table were synchronized to show the same data.

## 5. Admin Transaction Table Enhancements
- A new endpoint `/api/wallet/admin/transactions/` was added to provide a paginated list of all wallet transactions with user info.
- The table was updated to fetch from this endpoint and display amounts as currency.
- The "Created At" column was formatted as a human-readable date.

## 6. Stat Card & Table Label/Order Updates
- Stat card labels were updated to: Transferred, Disbursed, Credited, Withdrawn, Balance.
- The order and formatting were adjusted to match Mawaddah’s finalized model and design guidelines.

## 7. Appeal Info in Transactions
- The admin transaction API was updated to include appeal info (id, title, status, amount_requested).
- The table now shows the appeal title as a white text link.
- Clicking the link opens a Drawer with full appeal details, fetched live from `/api/appeals/{id}/`.

## 8. Drawer & Appeal Detail
- The Drawer uses the shared component and displays all key appeal fields (title, category, status, amount, beneficiary, description, created/approved/rejected/cancelled info, rejection reason, and is_donor_linked).
- The Drawer fetches data live and handles loading/error states.

## 9. Authentication & API Access
- Attempts to fetch appeal details via terminal failed due to missing authentication.
- The assistant explained how to view the data via the frontend or browser DevTools, and how to use session cookies/tokens for authenticated API calls.

## 10. Final State
- The Mawaddah Wallet Admin Analytics dashboard is fully functional, with all analytics, transaction, and appeal info integrated and accessible via a modern, user-friendly UI.
- All backend and frontend code follows project architecture, design, and testing standards.
- The user was guided through every step, with all issues resolved and enhancements implemented as requested.
